## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](../.assets/plan.png)

DevKit2 streams audio via Bluetooth using OPUS codec. The processing pipeline includes:

**Audio Processing:**
- Bluetooth audio capture from OMI devices
- OPUS codec streaming to backend services
- WebSocket-based real-time audio transport

**Transcription Services:**
- Cloud-based: Deepgram API for high-quality transcription
- Self-hosted: Local ASR services (Parakeet, Moonshine)

**AI Processing:**
- LLM-based conversation analysis (OpenAI or local Ollama)
- **Dual memory system**: Friend-Lite native or OpenMemory MCP integration
- Enhanced memory extraction with individual fact storage
- **Semantic search** with relevance scoring and threshold filtering
- Smart deduplication and memory updates (ADD/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Action item detection

**Data Storage:**
- MongoDB: User data, conversations, and transcripts
- Qdrant: Vector storage for semantic memory search
- Audio files: Optional conversation recording

## Audio Streaming Protocol

Backends and ASR services use standardized audio streaming:
- Consistent audio streaming format
- Interoperable with external systems
- Modular ASR service architecture
- Easy to swap ASR providers

## Deployment Scenarios

### Single Machine (Recommended for beginners)
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Run interactive setup**: `uv run --with-requirements setup-requirements.txt python init.py`
3. **Start all services**: `python services.py start --all --build`
4. **Access WebUI**: `http://localhost:5173` for the React web dashboard

### Distributed Setup (Advanced users with multiple machines)
1. **GPU Machine**: Deploy LLM services (Ollama, ASR, Speaker Recognition)
   ```bash
   # Ollama with GPU
   docker run -d --gpus=all -p 11434:11434 ollama/ollama:latest
   
   # ASR services
   cd extras/asr-services && docker compose up moonshine -d
   
   # Speaker recognition
   cd extras/speaker-recognition && docker compose up --build -d
   ```

2. **Backend Machine**: Deploy lightweight services
   ```bash
   cd backends/advanced
   
   # Configure distributed services in .env
   OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://[gpu-machine-tailscale-ip]:11434
   SPEAKER_SERVICE_URL=http://[gpu-machine-tailscale-ip]:8001
   
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **Tailscale Networking**: Connect machines securely
   ```bash
   # On each machine
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   sudo tailscale up
   ```

## Use Case Recommendations

### For Beginners
