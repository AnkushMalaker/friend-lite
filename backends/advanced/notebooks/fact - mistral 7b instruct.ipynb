    "First ever technology which isn't just about enabling people to get what they want, but about the technology itself getting what it wants. And what does it want? Well, it would be cool if we had some reliable way of knowing that or updating it or making sure it's what we intended. Technology is good. AI will be different, and that difference has a lot of effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps most importantly, the normal methods we use for other technology where we deal with each new problem as it comes up just aren't up to the task of dealing with AGI by default. Advanced AI can hide problems from us, manipulate us, and interfere with our attempts to fix things. Our standard safety methods and societal processes are not set up to deal with technological systems that can intelligently act against us. Like, we invented CFCs. They made a hole in the ozone layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We developed new refrigerants that didn't have that problem and mandated their use, and now the ozone hole is closing. CFCs weren't able hide the hole in the ozone layer or pin the blame on some other kind of molecule. CFCs are just simple chemical compounds. Similarly, we invented planes. They crashed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We figured out why and improved the technology. They crashed again. We fixed those problems. They crashed again. We repeated this in honestly kind of embarrassingly large number of times, and now planes are extremely safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "But planes aren't able notice when they're being tested and behave differently to make sure they pass the tests so that they can make sure to crash only when they're carrying real passengers. None of the people involved wants that, and planes are just tools. In the same way, we invented nuclear power. We had Chernobyl and 3 Mile Island. We improved the technology, and now nuclear power is much safer than fossil fuels and should have been powering everything for a while now.\n",
    "\n",
    "But nuclear power plants aren't able to carefully observe our safety protocols in order to decide the best way to melt down and the best time to do it so that it's least likely to be contained. Power plants aren't agents. AGI is different from all other technology. And notice how in all of those examples, hazard did have to actually happen often several times, and we responded to it after that. We did have a nuclear power plant actually melt down.\n",
    "\n",
    "We did have a ton of planes actually crash and kill real people, and we fixed the problems once they'd already happened. AGI may not give us so many chances. The regular approach, where you have the full blown form of the hazard happen and then you learn from it, that only works if the hazard is recoverable. AGI risks are not necessarily necessarily recoverable. If we lose control of the world, we've lost it permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shouldn't expect to be able to get it back from an intelligent adversary. Has humanity ever managed to rein in a large scale risk before the full blown form of the hazard has actually happened at least once? Kind of. With nuclear weapons. We had some very close calls, but we've so far just about managed to avoid having a global thermonuclear war.\n",
    "\n",
    "How did we achieve that? Well, we developed a new technology. We saw that a potentially unrecoverable outcome was possible, and then we freaked out and did unprecedented things to prevent it from happening. In that case, humanity correctly recognized that there are certain risks that you can't have happen even once because they're not recoverable. We can have a pretty big global pandemic and come back from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can even come back from a medium sized nuclear exchange, but we can't have AI take over the world one time, say, whoops, figure out what went wrong, learn from our mistake, and move on. Once we lose, we've lost. We can't be driven extinct and then patch the issue in the next release. Technology is good, and it usually shouldn't be slowed down too much by safety concerns. This is true of technology broadly, including almost all AI technology up until this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "But advanced artificial general intelligence that grew out of my Discord server. It's awesome. They've got answers to hundreds of the most common questions about AI safety. There's even a chatbot you can talk to. It's very cool, and it's a great place to send new people.\n",
