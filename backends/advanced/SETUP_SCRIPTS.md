- Configures nginx proxy for HTTPS access
- Configures nginx for automatic HTTPS access
- Provides HTTPS URLs for dashboard access

### After HTTPS setup:
```bash
# Start services with HTTPS
docker compose up --build -d

# Access via HTTPS
https://localhost/
https://100.83.66.30/  # Your configured IP
```
