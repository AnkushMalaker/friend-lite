# Use these backends to your hearts content.
Each should have its own readme

First, these backends expect audio in the form of opus. They are saved after decoding using the Python SDK. The audio is simply saved in the simple backend and the advanced backend. It is sent to another service which can give you transcripts. This service can be accessed through the ASR services directory.

The simple backend is a simple backend that saves the audio to a file and then uses the ASR service to get the transcripts.

The advanced backend is a more advanced backend that uses the ASR service to get the transcripts.
