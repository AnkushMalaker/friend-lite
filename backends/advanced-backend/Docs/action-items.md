# Action Items Configuration and Usage

> ðŸ“– **Prerequisite**: Read [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md) first for system overview.

## Overview

The friend-lite backend includes a comprehensive action items system that automatically extracts tasks and commitments from conversations. This system operates in **real-time** alongside the memory extraction system, providing immediate task detection and management capabilities.

**Code References**:
- **Main Implementation**: `src/action_items_service.py` (MongoDB-based storage and processing)
- **Real-time Processing**: `main.py:1341-1378` (per-transcript-segment processing)
- **API Endpoints**: `main.py:2671-2800` (action items CRUD operations)
- **Configuration**: `memory_config.yaml` (action_item_extraction section)

## Architecture

### Dual Processing System

The action items system operates in parallel with memory extraction:

```
Audio â†’ Transcription â†’ Dual Processing
                      â”œâ”€ Memory Pipeline (end-of-conversation)
                      â””â”€ Action Item Pipeline (real-time per-segment)
```

### Key Components

1. **Real-time Detection**: Each transcript segment is checked for action item triggers
2. **Configurable Extraction**: YAML-based configuration for prompts and triggers
3. **MongoDB Storage**: Action items stored in dedicated collection with full CRUD
4. **Debug Tracking**: SQLite-based tracking of extraction process
5. **User-Centric Design**: All action items keyed by user_id, not client_id

### Architecture Cleanup

**Previous Issue**: The system had duplicated action item processing in two places:
- `ActionItemsService` (MongoDB-based, primary handler)
- `MemoryService` (Mem0-based, unused legacy code)

**Current Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns:
- **`ActionItemsService`**: Handles ALL action item operations (MongoDB-based)
- **`MemoryService`**: Handles ONLY memory operations (Mem0-based)
- **Debug System**: Tracks both memories and action items in unified SQLite database

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration (`memory_config.yaml`)

**Configuration Loading**: See `src/memory_config_loader.py:get_action_item_extraction_config()` for how this configuration is loaded and used.

```yaml
action_item_extraction:
  # Enable/disable action item extraction
  enabled: true
  
  # Trigger phrases that indicate action items
  trigger_phrases:
    - "simon says"        # Primary trigger (case-insensitive)
    - "action item"       # Explicit action item
    - "todo"              # Simple todo
    - "follow up"         # Follow-up tasks
    - "next step"         # Next steps
    - "homework"          # Assignments
    - "deliverable"       # Project deliverables
    - "deadline"          # Time-sensitive tasks
    - "schedule"          # Scheduling tasks
    - "reminder"          # Reminders
  
  # LLM extraction prompt
  prompt: |
    Extract actionable tasks and commitments from this conversation.
    
    Look for:
    - Explicit commitments ("I'll send you the report")
    - Requested actions ("Can you review the document?")
    - Scheduled tasks ("We need to meet next week")
    - Follow-up items ("Let's check on this tomorrow")
    - Deliverables mentioned ("The presentation is due Friday")
    
    For each action item, determine:
    - What needs to be done (clear, specific description)
    - Who is responsible (assignee)
    - When it's due (deadline if mentioned)
    - Priority level (high/medium/low)
    
    Return ONLY valid JSON array. If no action items found, return [].
    
    Example format:
    [
      {
        "description": "Send project status report to team",
        "assignee": "John",
        "due_date": "Friday",
        "priority": "high",
        "context": "Discussed in weekly team meeting"
      }
    ]
  
  # LLM settings for action item extraction
  llm_settings:
    temperature: 0.1      # Low temperature for consistent extraction
    max_tokens: 1000      # Sufficient for multiple action items
    model: "llama3.1:latest"  # Can be overridden by environment
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
action_item_extraction:
  enabled: true
  
  # Enhanced trigger detection
  trigger_phrases:
    - "simon says"
    - "action item"
    - "i need to"
    - "we should"
    - "let's"
    - "can you"
    - "please"
    - "remember to"
    - "don't forget"
    - "make sure"
  
  # Custom extraction prompt with specific instructions
  prompt: |
    You are an expert task manager. Extract actionable items from this conversation.
    
    Focus on:
    1. Specific commitments with clear ownership
    2. Time-bound tasks with deadlines
    3. Follow-up actions requiring completion
    4. Deliverables with clear outcomes
    
    For each action item, provide:
    - description: Clear, specific task description
    - assignee: Person responsible (use "unassigned" if unclear)
    - due_date: Deadline if mentioned (use "not_specified" if not clear)
    - priority: Based on urgency (high/medium/low/not_specified)
    - context: Brief context about when/why this was mentioned
    
    Return ONLY valid JSON array. Empty array if no action items found.
  
  # Fine-tuned LLM parameters
  llm_settings:
    temperature: 0.05     # Very low for consistent extraction
    max_tokens: 1500      # More tokens for detailed extraction
    model: "llama3.1:latest"
```

## Usage Examples

### Trigger Phrase Examples

The system detects action items when trigger phrases are present:

```
âœ… "Simon says we need to schedule a follow-up meeting"
âœ… "Action item: John will send the report by Friday"
âœ… "Todo: Review the contract before tomorrow"
âœ… "Follow up with the client about their requirements"
âœ… "Next step is to finalize the budget proposal"
âœ… "Can you please update the documentation?"
âœ… "Let's schedule a review meeting for next week"
âœ… "Don't forget to submit the quarterly report"
```

### Action Item Data Structure

```json
{
  "description": "Send project status report to team",
  "assignee": "John Smith",
  "due_date": "Friday, December 15th",
  "priority": "high",
  "status": "open",
  "context": "Discussed in weekly team meeting",
  "audio_uuid": "audio_12345",
  "client_id": "user1-laptop",
  "user_id": "user1",
  "created_at": 1703548800,
  "updated_at": 1703548800
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Action Items Management

**API Implementation**: See `main.py:2671-2800` for complete CRUD endpoint implementations.

```bash
# Get user's action items
GET /api/action_items?status=open&limit=20

# Get specific action item
GET /api/action_items/{action_item_id}

# Update action item status
PUT /api/action_items/{action_item_id}
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "status": "completed"
}

# Search action items
GET /api/action_items/search?query=report&status=open

# Delete action item
DELETE /api/action_items/{action_item_id}
```

### Debug & Monitoring

```bash
# View action item extraction stats
GET /api/debug/memory/stats

# View recent action item sessions
GET /api/debug/memory/sessions

# Debug specific session
GET /api/debug/memory/session/{audio_uuid}

# View pipeline trace
GET /api/debug/memory/pipeline/{audio_uuid}
```

## Debug Tracking

The system tracks all action item extraction attempts:

### What's Tracked

- **Extraction Attempts**: Success/failure of each extraction
- **Processing Time**: How long each extraction takes
- **Prompt Used**: Which prompt was used for extraction
- **LLM Model**: Which model performed the extraction
- **Transcript Length**: Size of input text
- **Error Details**: Specific error messages for failed extractions

### Debug Database Schema

```sql
-- Action item extractions are stored as memory_extractions with type='action_item'
SELECT 
    audio_uuid,
    memory_text,
    extraction_prompt,
    metadata_json,
    created_at
FROM memory_extractions 
WHERE memory_type = 'action_item';

-- Processing attempts show success/failure patterns
SELECT 
    audio_uuid,
    attempt_type,
    success,
    error_message,
    processing_time_ms
FROM extraction_attempts 
WHERE attempt_type = 'action_item_extraction';
```

## Performance Optimization

### Configuration Tips

1. **Adjust Trigger Phrases**: Add domain-specific triggers for your use case
2. **Tune LLM Parameters**: Lower temperature for consistency, higher for creativity
3. **Optimize Prompts**: Include examples specific to your workflow
4. **Monitor Processing Time**: Use debug endpoints to identify bottlenecks

### Quality Control

```yaml
quality_control:
  # Skip very short transcripts
  min_conversation_length: 10
  
  # Skip transcripts with low meaningful content
  skip_low_content: true
  min_content_ratio: 0.2
  
  # Skip common filler patterns
  skip_patterns:
    - "^(um|uh|hmm|yeah|ok|okay)\\s*$"
    - "^test\\s*$"
```

## Integration with Memory System

Action items and memories work together:

1. **Shared Debug Tracking**: Both use the same SQLite debug database
2. **Coordinated Processing**: Both respect the same quality control settings
3. **User-Centric Storage**: Both keyed by user_id for proper isolation
4. **Unified Configuration**: Single YAML file controls both systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Action Items Detected**
   - Check if trigger phrases are present in transcript
   - Verify `action_item_extraction.enabled: true` in config
   - Check debug logs for extraction attempts

2. **JSON Parsing Errors**
   - Review extraction prompt for clarity
   - Lower LLM temperature for more consistent output
   - Check debug database for exact error messages

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor processing times in debug stats
   - Adjust `max_tokens` and `temperature` settings
   - Consider using quality control to filter low-value transcripts

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test action item configuration
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/debug/memory/config/test?test_text=Simon%20says%20we%20need%20to%20schedule%20a%20meeting"

# View extraction statistics
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/debug/memory/stats

# Check recent processing
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/debug/memory/sessions?limit=10
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Trigger Phrases**: Add domain-specific triggers for your use case
2. **Test Prompts Regularly**: Use the debug API to test prompt effectiveness
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check debug stats for processing times and success rates
4. **Customize for Your Workflow**: Adjust prompts and triggers based on your conversation patterns
5. **Regular Configuration Updates**: Reload configuration without restart using the API

This action items system provides comprehensive task management capabilities with full configurability and debugging support, integrating seamlessly with the memory extraction pipeline.
