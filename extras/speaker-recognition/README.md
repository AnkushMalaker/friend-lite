# Speaker Recognition System

A comprehensive speaker recognition system with web-based UI for audio annotation, speaker enrollment, and data management.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Hugging Face account (for model access)
- 8GB+ RAM, 10GB+ disk space

### 1. Configure environment variables
```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env and add your Hugging Face token
```
Get your HF token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
Accept the terms and conditions for 
https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1
https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0


### 2. Choose CPU or GPU setup
```bash
# For CPU-only (lighter, works on any machine)
uv sync --group cpu

# For GPU acceleration (requires NVIDIA GPU + CUDA)
uv sync --group gpu
```

If you choose GPU, uncomment the deploy section with GPU requirements from docker-compose.yml

### 3. Run Setup Script

```bash
cd extras/speaker-recognition
./init.sh
```

This interactive setup will guide you through:
- Configuring your Hugging Face token
- Choosing compute mode (CPU/GPU)
- Setting up HTTPS for remote access (optional)

For non-interactive setup:
```bash
./init.sh --hf-token YOUR_TOKEN --compute-mode cpu
# Or for HTTPS with specific IP:
./init.sh --hf-token YOUR_TOKEN --compute-mode gpu --enable-https --server-ip 100.83.66.30
```

### 4. Start the system
```bash
# For CPU-only
docker compose --profile cpu up --build -d

# For GPU acceleration
docker compose --profile gpu up --build -d
```

This starts three services:
- **FastAPI backend** on port 8085 (internal API service)
- **React web UI** on port configured by REACT_UI_PORT (defaults vary by mode)
- **Nginx proxy** on ports 8444 (HTTPS) and 8081 (HTTP redirect)

**⚠️ Important**: Use the same profile when stopping:
```bash
# Stop CPU services
docker compose --profile cpu down

# Stop GPU services
docker compose --profile gpu down
```

### 5. Access the Web UI

**HTTPS Mode (Recommended for microphone access):**
- **Secure Access**: https://localhost:8444/ or https://your-ip:8444/
- **HTTP Redirect**: http://localhost:8081/ → https://localhost:8444/

**HTTP Mode (Fallback, microphone limited to localhost):**
- **Direct Access**: http://localhost:5174/ (or configured REACT_UI_PORT)
- **API Access**: http://localhost:8085/

**Microphone access requires HTTPS for network connections (not just localhost).**

### 6. Get Started
1. **Create a user** using the sidebar
2. **Upload audio** in the "Audio Viewer" page
3. **Annotate segments** in the "Annotation" page

## 🖥️ React Web UI

The modern React interface provides an enhanced user experience with:

### Pages
- **Audio Viewer**: Interactive waveform visualization with click-to-play
- **Annotation**: Label speaker segments with Deepgram transcript support
- **Enrollment**: Record or upload audio with real-time quality assessment
- **Speakers**: Manage enrolled speakers with sample counts and duration metrics
- **Inference**: Identify speakers in new audio files with confidence scores

### Key Features
- **Recording Support**: Direct microphone recording with WebM to WAV conversion
- **Enrollment Options**: 
  - Create new speaker enrollment
  - Append to existing speaker (weighted embedding averaging)
  - Direct enrollment from annotation segments
- **Real-time Metrics**: Track sample counts and total audio duration
- **Quality Assessment**: SNR-based quality scoring with visual indicators
- **Export Options**: Download processed audio and annotation data

### Live Inference Improvements

The live inference feature has been significantly enhanced with the following improvements:

- **Dynamic Sample Rate Detection**: No longer assumes 16kHz, automatically detects browser audio context sample rate
- **Extended Audio Buffer Retention**: Increased from 30 seconds to 120 seconds for better utterance capture
- **Fixed Timing Synchronization**: Resolved timestamp display issues and audio/speaker alignment
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting live audio processing
- **Audio Buffer Stability**: Fixed stale closure issues with audio buffer management using React refs

### Confidence Threshold Control

The React UI includes an adjustable confidence threshold on the Inference page that controls speaker identification strictness:

- **Range**: 0.00 to 1.00 (adjustable in 0.05 increments)
- **Default**: 0.50 (balanced accuracy vs coverage)
- **"Less Strict" (lower values)**: More segments identified as known speakers, but potentially more false positives
- **"More Strict" (higher values)**: Fewer segments identified, but higher accuracy for identified speakers
- **Typical ECAPA-TDNN values**: 0.10-0.30 for most use cases
- **Additional filtering**: Results can be filtered by confidence after processing

## 📖 Deepgram Response Processing Utilities

The speaker recognition system includes robust utilities for handling Deepgram API responses. **Always use these utilities instead of manual parsing.**

### 🛠️ Core Utilities

#### DeepgramParser (`src/simple_speaker_recognition/utils/deepgram_parser.py`)
**Purpose**: Robust parsing of Deepgram JSON responses with speaker segmentation
**Key Features**:
- Handles both diarized and non-diarized responses
- Groups words by speaker changes into natural segments
- Automatic segment merging and filtering
- Speaker statistics and confidence tracking
- Converts to annotation format

**Basic Usage**:
```python
from simple_speaker_recognition.utils.deepgram_parser import DeepgramParser

parser = DeepgramParser(min_segment_duration=0.5)
parsed_data = parser.parse_deepgram_json("deepgram_response.json")

# Access structured data
segments = parsed_data['segments']  # Clean speaker segments
speakers = parsed_data['unique_speakers']  # List of speaker labels
transcript = parsed_data['transcript']  # Full transcript text
```

#### TranscriptProcessor (`src/simple_speaker_recognition/utils/transcript_processor.py`)
**Purpose**: High-level transcript processing and formatting utilities
**Key Features**:
- Extract segments directly from Deepgram response objects
- Format transcripts with speaker names and timestamps
- Merge consecutive segments and filter short ones
- Export to JSON with metadata and statistics
- Handle both diarized and non-diarized content gracefully

**Basic Usage**:
```python
from simple_speaker_recognition.utils.transcript_processor import TranscriptProcessor

processor = TranscriptProcessor()

# Extract segments from live Deepgram response
segments = processor.extract_segments_from_deepgram(deepgram_response)

# Format for display
transcript_text = processor.format_transcript_text(
    segments, 
    include_timestamps=True,
    speaker_names={0: "John", 1: "Jane"}
)

# Quick processing with cleanup
from simple_speaker_recognition.utils.transcript_processor import quick_process_deepgram_response
clean_segments = quick_process_deepgram_response(deepgram_response)
```

### 🎯 YouTube Audio CLI Integration

The YouTube audio processing CLI uses these utilities for clean, robust Deepgram response handling:

```bash
# Download, convert, and transcribe with proper utilities
python scripts/youtube_cli.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." --no-diarization

# With custom settings
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_key uv run python scripts/youtube_cli.py "URL" \
  --language multi --output-dir custom-outputs --no-original
```

**Features**:
- Uses `TranscriptProcessor.extract_segments_from_deepgram()` for parsing
- Uses `TranscriptProcessor.format_transcript_text()` for output
- Handles both diarized and non-diarized transcription seamlessly
- Organized output structure with raw JSON, formatted transcripts, and audio files

**CLI Options**:
- `--deepgram-key KEY`: Deepgram API key (or use DEEPGRAM_API_KEY env var)
- `--output-dir DIR`: Output directory (default: outputs)
- `--language LANG`: Language for transcription (default: multi)
- `--no-original`: Skip downloading original high-quality audio
- `--no-diarization`: Disable speaker diarization

**Output Structure**:
```
outputs/
├── audio/
│   ├── video-title-original.wav          # Original quality
│   └── video-title-processed-16khz-mono-1.wav  # 16kHz mono for transcription
├── transcripts/
│   └── video-title-segment-1-transcript.txt    # Formatted transcript
├── json/
│   └── video-title-segment-1-deepgram-raw.json # Raw Deepgram response
└── video-title-SUMMARY.txt               # Processing summary
```

### 📚 Deepgram Terminology in Speaker Recognition Context

When working with Deepgram responses, you'll encounter different data structures:

#### Words
- **What**: Individual word-level transcription data with precise timestamps
- **Use**: Most accurate for speaker boundaries and timing
- **Example**: `{"word": "hello", "start": 1.23, "end": 1.45, "speaker": 0}`

#### Segments  
- **What**: Groups of consecutive words from the same speaker
- **Use**: Natural speech chunks for annotation and training
- **Generated by**: DeepgramParser groups words by speaker changes
- **Example**: Speaker 1 talks from 0-5s, then Speaker 2 from 5-10s

#### Paragraphs/Sentences
- **What**: Deepgram's paragraph-level grouping based on pauses/context
- **Use**: Better for readability but less precise for speaker boundaries
- **Note**: May combine multiple speakers if they talk quickly
- **Example**: A paragraph might span 30-60 seconds with multiple speakers

#### Best Practice
The speaker recognition system uses **word-level data** to create segments because:
- Exact speaker change points (critical for training)
- No overlapping speakers in a segment
- Accurate timing for audio extraction

**⚠️ Important**: Always use the provided utilities instead of manual `channels[0]['alternatives'][0]` parsing:
- **❌ Don't**: `response_dict['results']['channels'][0]['alternatives'][0]['words']`
- **✅ Do**: `TranscriptProcessor.extract_segments_from_deepgram(response)`

When you see issues with transcript processing:
- Use the structured utilities for consistent results
- Check if you're mixing word-level vs paragraph-level data
- Re-process using current utilities for best results

## 🔧 Configuration

Environment variables:
```bash
# Required
HF_TOKEN="your_token"                    # Required: Hugging Face token for PyAnnote models

# Speaker Service Configuration  
SPEAKER_SERVICE_HOST="0.0.0.0"          # Speaker service bind host
SPEAKER_SERVICE_PORT="8085"             # Speaker service port (default: 8085)
SPEAKER_SERVICE_URL="http://speaker-service:8085"  # URL for internal Docker communication
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD="0.15"             # Speaker similarity threshold (0.1-0.3 typical for ECAPA-TDNN)

# React Web UI Configuration

```

Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and configure your settings:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## 🔒 HTTPS and Microphone Access

**For Internal VPN/Network Usage:**

The React UI is configured with HTTPS enabled by default (`REACT_UI_HTTPS=true`) to support microphone recording features, which require secure contexts in modern browsers.

### **First-time Setup:**
1. **Access**: Navigate to https://localhost:5173
2. **Certificate Warning**: Your browser will show a security warning for the self-signed certificate
3. **Accept Certificate**: Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" or similar
4. **One-time Setup**: This only needs to be done once per browser

### **Why HTTPS is Required:**
- **Browser Security**: Modern browsers require HTTPS for microphone access via `getUserMedia()` API
- **Internal Networks**: Self-signed certificates are acceptable for VPN/internal tools
- **Recording Features**: Both Enrollment and Inference pages need microphone access for live recording

### **Alternative Access:**
- **HTTP Fallback**: Set `REACT_UI_HTTPS=false` in `.env` and use http://localhost:5173
- **Limitation**: Microphone recording will not work without HTTPS (file upload still works)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Can't access the web UI?**
- Check if services are running: `docker compose --profile cpu ps` (or `--profile gpu`)
- View logs: `docker compose --profile cpu logs web-ui`

**Speaker service not responding?**
- Check backend logs: `docker compose --profile cpu logs speaker-service`
- Verify HF_TOKEN is set correctly

**Models not downloading?**
- Ensure HF_TOKEN has access to PyAnnote models
- Check network connection and disk space

## 🔄 Development

For local development without Docker:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
uv sync
uv run python speaker_service.py

# Terminal 2 - React Web UI  
cd webui && npm run dev
```

## Integration with Advanced Backend

The advanced backend communicates with this service through the `client.py` module, which provides both async and sync interfaces for backward compatibility.

## Laptop Client

A command-line client (`laptop_client.py`) that can record from your microphone and interact with the speaker recognition service.

### Setup for Laptop Client

The laptop client requires PyAudio for microphone access:

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio

# On macOS
brew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio

# On Windows
pip install pyaudio
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Start the speaker service first
docker compose --profile cpu up -d

# Enroll a new speaker (records 10 seconds)
python laptop_client.py enroll --speaker-id "john" --speaker-name "John Doe" --duration 10

# Identify a speaker (records 5 seconds)
python laptop_client.py identify --duration 5

# Verify against a specific speaker (records 3 seconds)
python laptop_client.py verify --speaker-id "john" --duration 3

# List all enrolled speakers
python laptop_client.py list

# Remove a speaker
python laptop_client.py remove --speaker-id "john"

# Use different service URL
python laptop_client.py --service-url "http://192.168.1.100:8001" identify
```

### Laptop Client Features

- **Live Microphone Recording**: Records directly from your system microphone
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary audio files are automatically cleaned up
- **Service Health Checks**: Verifies the speaker service is online before operations
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows recording progress and results with emojis
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network and audio errors

## Testing

### Integration Tests

The service includes comprehensive integration tests that validate the complete speaker recognition pipeline:

```bash
# Run integration tests (requires HF_TOKEN in environment)
cd extras/speaker-recognition
source .env && export HF_TOKEN && uv run pytest tests/test_speaker_service_integration.py -v -s
```

#### Test Requirements
- **Environment Variables**: `HF_TOKEN` must be set (for pyannote models)
- **Docker**: Must be available for test containers
- **Test Assets**: Audio files for Evan and Katelyn speakers (included in `tests/assets/`)

#### What the Tests Cover
1. **Service Health**: Verifies Docker containers start and service is accessible
2. **Speaker Enrollment**: Batch enrollment of multiple speakers with audio files  
3. **Database Persistence**: Confirms speakers are stored correctly
4. **Individual Identification**: Tests single-speaker identification accuracy
5. **Conversation Processing**: Full conversation analysis with speaker diarization

#### Test Configuration
- **Test Compose**: Uses `docker-compose-test.yml` with isolated test containers
- **Test Port**: Service runs on port 8086 (vs. 8085 for development)
- **Keep Containers**: Set `SPEAKER_TEST_KEEP_CONTAINERS=1` to debug test failures

### Docker Compose Files

The service provides two Docker Compose configurations:

| File | Purpose | Service Port | Use Case |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|
| `docker-compose.yml` | Development/Production | 8085 | Normal usage, WebUI access |
| `docker-compose-test.yml` | Testing | 8086 | Integration tests, isolated environment |

## Integration with Advanced Backend

The advanced backend communicates with this service through the `client.py` module, which provides both async and sync interfaces for backward compatibility.

## Performance Notes

### CPU vs GPU Performance
- **CPU Mode**: Slower inference (~10-30s for enrollment), smaller memory footprint (~2-4GB)
- **GPU Mode**: Faster inference (~2-5s for enrollment), requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (~4-8GB VRAM)
- **Model Loading**: First inference may be slow due to model loading (both modes)
- **Deployment**: Use CPU mode for CI/testing, GPU mode for production workloads

### General Performance
- Audio files should be accessible from both services (use shared volumes)
- Microphone recording dynamically detects browser sample rate (typically 44.1kHz or 48kHz) for optimal compatibility
- Microphone recording requires `pyaudio` and proper audio device setup
